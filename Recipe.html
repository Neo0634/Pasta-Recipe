        <p>A judicious amount of heavy cream enriches this simple tomato sauce, producing a lush texture that clings to the pasta without blanketing richnese for any night of the week.</p>
         <p>This recipe is inspired by sommelier Derrick C. Westbrook of 1340 Beer Wine Spirits in Chicago, who named it his ideal dish for pairing with wine.</p>
         <p>The addition of cream and butter heightens this simple tomato sauce without making it heavy. It's special but not extravagant, a wonderful choice.</p>
